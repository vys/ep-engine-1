* Configuring the Engine

Engine parameters may be specified using the =-e= option to
memcached.  These parameters control various aspects of the behavior
of the engine.

For example, if you would like to store your database in =/data/base=
and prevent it from having objects larger than 1MB, you would run
memcached like this:

: memcached -E ep.so -e 'kvstore_config_file=/etc/kvconf.json;max_item_size=1048576'

** KVStore Config file format

The kvstore config file is to be written in a JSON format with specific
parameters described below. The path to the file should be passed to memcached
using the parameter kvstore_config_file. If not specified, ep-engine uses a
default config JSON string {"kvstores":{}} which produces a single kvstore with
default values for every parameter. Since memcached will not give parse error
details, you may use the python tool at tools/check_valid_json.py and pass the
json file as argument to see if it parses it and prints correctly. In case of
a parse error, this script specifies the line/column number where the parse
failed.

The kvstore config parameter expects an object type with exactly one key by the
name "kvstores" mapping to an object containing all the kvstores that need to
be configured. Every kvstore is a mapping between a string name for the kvstore
and its configuration. The configuration for each kvstore is specified with the
following parameters:

| key                    | type   | descr                                      |
|------------------------+--------+--------------------------------------------|
| dbname                 | string | Path to on-disk storage. (default:         |
|                        |        | /tmp/test.db)                              |
| shardpattern           | string | File pattern for shards (see below)        |
|                        |        | (default: %d/%b-%i.sqlite)                 |
| initfile               | string | SQL script to run after opening DB         |
|                        |        | (default: empty string, i.e. no file)      |
| postInitfile           | string | SQL script to run after all DB shards and  |
|                        |        | statements have been initialized           |
|                        |        | (default: empty string, i.e. no file)      |
| db_shards              | int    | Number of shards for db store (default: 4) |
| db_strategy            | string | DB store strategy ("multiDB", "singleDB"   |
|                        |        | or "singleMTDB") (default: multiDB)        |
| data_dbnames           | array  | Array of strings each pointing to a db     |
|                        |        | path. Based on the number of shards, the   |
|                        |        | sharding is done on these paths in a round |
|                        |        | robin mechanism. (default: empty array)    |

dbname is where every kvstore centralizes it's store. Every data file (based
on the value of db_shards) is sharded based on the pattern specified onto the
paths given in data_dbnames. If this array is empty, the sharding is done on
dbname. The list of all dbname values and the paths resulting in sharding
across all kvstores is not allowed to have any duplicate paths. ep-engine
validates the config and fails in such a scenario.

To view the list of paths that have been generated using the shard patterns,
use "stats kvstore".

See a sample kvstore configuration below.

** Shard Patterns

When using a multi-sharded database, =shardpattern= specifies how
shards are named relative to a data path. As described above, the
data path is picked up in a round-robin way from data_dbnames for
each shard number, unless this array is empty in which case dbname
is used.

=shardpattern= uses a printf-style string to expand the path with the
given variables:

- =%d= : The directory name containing the main database
  (This will be =.= for relative paths).
- =%b= : The base name of the main database.
- =%i= : The shard number.

The default value of =shardpattern= is =%d/%b-%i.sqlite=

** Sample kvstore config

{
    "kvstores" : {
        "kvstore1" : {
            "dbname" : "/tmp/test2.db",
            "initfile" : "/opt/membase/membase-init.sql",
            "data_dbnames" : [
                "/tmp/test1.db",
                "/tmp/test2.db"
            ]
        },
        "kvstore2" : {
            "initfile" : "/opt/membase/membase-init.sql",
            "dbname" : "/tmp/test2.db-3.s"
        },
        "kv3": {
            "initfile" : "/opt/membase/membase-init.sql"
        },
        "kv4": {
            "dbname" : "/tmp/test5.db",
            "initfile" : "/opt/membase/membase-init.sql",
            "data_dbnames" : [
                "/tmp/t1.db",
                "/tmp/t2.db",
                "/tmp/t3.db"
            ],
            "db_shards" : 10
        }
    }
}

("kv3" obtains all the default parameter values. Note that none of
the dbname paths and shardpattern generated paths repeat.)
